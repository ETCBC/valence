first.

* **Visualization** A 
  [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/blob/master/notebooks/senses.ipynb)

* **Data module** A 
  [module of higher level features](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/tree/master/tf/4b)
  for **text-fabric** on which flowchart decisions have been based, as well as a feature that
  contains the decisions themselves;

  used in the workflows for correction and enrichment, containing the manual edits;
* **Documents** describing concrete flowcharts for individual verbs, to be found in the

* **Program code** A
  [bunch of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/tree/master/notebooks)
