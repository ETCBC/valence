Study of verbal valence patterns in Biblical Hebrew. Part of the SYNVAR project.

# Results

The results of this study are being delivered in several forms, summarized here.
it might be helpful to consult a description of the
[sources](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/wiki/Sources)
first.

* **Annotations** A set of
  [annotations](https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/note?version=4b&id=Mnx2YWxlbmNl&tp=txt_tb1&nget=v)
  in **SHEBANQ** where the verbal valency analysis has been made explicit and viewable in context;
* **Data module** A 
  [module of higher level features](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/tree/master/tf/4b)
  for **text-fabric** on which flowchart decisions have been based, as well as a feature that
  contains the decisions themselves;
* **Corrections and enrichments**
  [CSV files](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/tree/master/workflow)
  used in the workflows for correction and enrichments, contain the manual edits;
* **Documents** describing concrete flowcharts for individual verbs, to be found in the
  [wiki](https://github.com/ETCBC/valence/wiki)
  of this repository;
* **Jupyter notebooks** that describe and execute:
  1. the data correction workflow, followed by enrichment;
  2. the application of the flowcharts to the whole corpus.
